But, I would say the service of Automechanica is much better in comparison to any authorized dealer in terms of quality, service and very reasonable charge. Even, I was surprised to get all updates through WhatsApp photos and videos. Really impressed with the service. I would recommend all my friends to go for Automechanica without a second thought.'

You are being notified about the progress of the work through WhatsApp pics which makes experience very transparent. Staff is helpful and courteous, mechanics are also experienced and skilled based on my experience. Overall I would highly recommend Auto Mechanica for general maintenance and denting and painting. The 2 services which I have availed from them yet.'
